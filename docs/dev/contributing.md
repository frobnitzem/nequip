# Contributing to NequIP

**!! If you want to make a major change, add a new feature, or have any uncertainty about where the change should go or how it should be designed, please reach out to discuss with us first. !!**



## Design Philosophy

 - Prioritize **extensibility** and **configurability** in core abstractions, we can also make simpler user-interfaces when needed.
 - It is preferable to add features with more code (e.g. subclassing core abstractions) than with more options (e.g. by adding new arguments to core abstractions) wherever possible.
 
 
## Code Standards

 ### Unittests
 
 For new features, write a **unittest** that covers it wherever possible. If it is a significant change to the training workflow, updating the integrations tests might be required.
 
 All additions should support CUDA/GPU. If possible, please test your changes on a GPU -- the CI tests on GitHub actions do not have GPU resources available.
 
 ### Documentation
 
  - Add **comments** for code whose purpose is not immediately obvious.
 
  - For new classes or functions that will be exposed to users, comprehensive user-facing docstrings are a must. We follow **Google-style Python docstrings**.
  
  - For new classes or functions that are not user-facing, docstrings and explanatory comments are strongly encouraged and will likely be asked for during code reviews.
  
   - Added options should be documented in the docs and changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file

 ### Style Enforcement
 We use the [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) code formatter with default settings and the [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter with settings:
  ```
  --ignore=E226,E501,E741,E743,C901,W503,E203 --max-line-length=127
  ```

  Please run the formatter before you commit and certainly before you make a PR. The formatter can be easily set up to run automatically on file save in various editors.
  
  You can also use ``pre-commit install`` to install a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook.

  You may need to install `black`, `flake8` and `Flake8-pyproject` (to read the `flake8` settings from `pyproject.toml`) to run the linter and formatter locally. If using a development IDE such as `VSCode` or `PyCharm`, you may need to update the default `flake8` config to match these settings (also listed in `pyproject.toml`).

 ### Git Practices

 PRs should generally come from feature branches.

 All PRs should be onto the `develop` branch or other feature branches, and **NOT** `main` (unless they fix a significant bug with immediate impact).

 On feature branches, it is preferable to `rebase` wherever possible, and `merge` only if the situation calls for it. We strive towards a clean and easily-readable commit history. Note that this does not apply to `develop` or `main` -- the commit history on these core branches are sacred.
