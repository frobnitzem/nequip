# Other integrations

A number of other codes offer integrations with `nequip`, NequIP, and Allegro:
 - [**Psiflow**](TODO): active learning and dataset generation framework
 - [**OpenMM**](TODO):
    ```{warning}
    [LAMMPS](./lammps.md) is the recommended simulation engine for `nequip` and, through `pair_allegro`, the only one that presently supports scaling to multi-GPU simulations.
    ```

    OpenMM is a molecular dynamics code with a flexible Python API and a particular focus on biomolecular systems. Thanks to community efforts, an interface that allows NequIP and Allegro to be used in OpenMM is available [here](TODO).
 - [] TODO their fortran quantum code
